			<p>Eureka: is a scientific program specialized in technological education 
			of innovation and engineering. Eureka is considered the first academy in 
			Jordan and the Arab world to develop the innovative capabilities of children 
			in the areas of technology and engineering. Eureka teaches children the basic 
			concepts of engineering and invention so they can transform ideas to useful 
			products and services.</p>
	
			<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
			It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
			making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
			Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
			consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word 
			in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
			
			<p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum 
			et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
			This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
			The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

	    	<p>Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. 
			It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. 
			It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites. Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet. 
			Development: Building the application from scratch. </p>

			<h2>Parts of web development</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Front-end development refers to the client-side (how a web page looks).</li>
				<li>Back-end development refers to the server-side (how a web page works).</li>
			</ul>
	
			<p>Front-end code is used to create static websites, where the purpose is to display the web page. 
			However, if you want to make your website dynamic (manage files and databases, add contact forms,
			control user-access, etc.), you need to learn a back-end programming language, like PHP or Python, and 
			use SQL to communicate with databases. Frontend Development: The part of a website that the user interacts 
			directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.</p>

			<p>Backend Development: Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users 
			cannot see and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the 
			users. It is used to store and arrange data.</p>
	
			<h2>Steps of web development</h2>

			<ol type="1">
				<li>Create your first web page: The first thing you have to learn, is HTML, 
					which is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</li>
	
				<li>Style your web page: The next step is to learn CSS, to set the layout of your web page with 
					beautiful colors, fonts, and much more.</li>
				
				<li>Make your web page interactive: After studying HTML and CSS, 
					you should learn JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages for your users.</li>
			</ol>
